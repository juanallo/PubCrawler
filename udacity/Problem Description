Description:
Pub Crawler is an application that lets you find out where your friends went out at night and which pubs and night clubs are hot.

Problem:

Tom has 23 years old, he had a pretty rough week full of tests and projects at the University. Weekend arrives and he wants to go out and party!
Sara, his study group friend, told him about a new place near, she says it is pretty fun. But Tom took her advice once and end up in a boring pub.
His other option is to go to the place he usually goes, but last weekend he met there with her ex girlfriend and it ruined the night.
He tries in Facebook, twitter, asking some friends, but the weekend arrives and he could not get a clue where to go.

Solution:

With Pub Crawler Tom can go an check which places are hot, an plan his night based on where other people is going.
And just in case he goes to a place it is not what he expected he can check places nearby and change his night!

Never make a bad decision ever again, make all your nights out rock!!!
